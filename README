This project uses pipenv to set the python version and deal with virtual environments (for the sake of consistency).

1. "brew install pipenv"
2. "pipenv shell"
3. "pipenv install"

To start, open shell and run main (assuming pipenv initialized to the project pipenv virtual env)- 
4. "python main.py"

To run tests, in the pipenv shell, run:
