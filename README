This project uses pipenv to set the python version and deal with virtual environments (for the sake of consistency).
https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/basics/

1. "brew install pipenv"

To start, open shell and run main (assuming pipenv initialized to the project pipenv virtual env)- 
"python main.py"

To run tests, in the pipenv shell, run:
"pytest"
